# Temperature Converter

## Description
This site takes in the input of a temperature, and by selecting the radio button of the unit of measurment (either Fahrenheit or Celcius) in which you wish to convert to, returns that new number. Depending on the _coolness_ or _warmness_ of the temperature, the color changes from blue, green, or red. 

## Getting Started
